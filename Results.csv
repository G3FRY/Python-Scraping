Barista training: If you have not worked at a coffee shop yet, do not worry; we will train you in coffee brewing and espresso making, including background information in the production and sourcing of specialty coffee.

Ability to multitask with ease is essential, while keeping a friendly attitude. We will provide a Fair Pass and a parking sticker, if needed. You must be very punctual. This is an hourly position; you can work 60 hours or less, depending on your schedule.   Work hours are 10:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
